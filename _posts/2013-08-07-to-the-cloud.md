Barely a month into the program, and we've already started taking baby steps into remote computing. Yesterday I launched my first instance on Amazon Web Services' Elastic Compute Cloud and created a virtual Linux box. It was really fun to mess around with tools like SSH & SCP and remember fondly the good old days at the command line. Uploading a few log files and manipulating them in python and the Linux console started to give me a sense of the power now at my fingertips. Can't wait to throw some big jobs at EC2 for some heavy lifting. Good times ahead!
